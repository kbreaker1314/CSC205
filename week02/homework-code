1. Create a new program called Time.cs. From now on, I won't remind you to start
  with a small, working program, but you should.
2. Following the example in Section 2.6, create variables named hour, minute and
  second, and assign them values that are roughly the current time. Use a 24-hour
  clock, so that at 2pm the value of hour is 14.
3. Make the program calculate and print the number of seconds since midnight.
4. Make the program calculate and print the number of seconds remaining in the day.
5. Make the program calculate and print the percentage of the day that has passed.
6. Change the values of hour, minute and second to reflect the current time (I assume
  that some time has elapsed), and check to make sure that the program works correctly
  with different values.

#2. Declare several variables by selecting for each one of them the most appropriate of the types: 
  sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long and ulong in order to assign them the following values:

#3: Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 1234)
and performs the following actions:
 - Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 1+2+3+4 = 10).
 - Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 4321).
 - Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 4123).
 - Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 1324).
To get the individual digits of the number, see below:
int a = num % 10; 
int b = (num / 10) % 10; 
int c = (num / 100) % 10; 
int d = (num / 1000) % 10;

            int b = (num / 100) % 10;
            int a = (num / 1000) % 10;
            Console.WriteLine($"The sum of four digits of {num} is {d + c + b + a}");
            Console.WriteLine($"{d}{c}{b}{a}");
